# REVERSE-PROXY
The goal of this guide is to set up an Nginx reverse proxy on an Ubuntu EC2 instance hosting a web application. The admin page will be restricted to access from a specific IP address, while other pages remain publicly accessible. This ensures security for the admin panel while keeping the application open for users.
